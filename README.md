# live-vehicle-tracking
Developed a real-time web application that visualizes the movement of vehicles on a map interface using React and Leaflet.js. The system fetches live location data through APIs and displays it dynamically on an interactive map, enabling users to monitor vehicle locations and movement paths in real-time.
